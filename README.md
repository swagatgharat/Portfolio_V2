# 🌐 Portfolio_V2

**Portfolio_V2** is the second iteration of my personal portfolio website - redesigned for better performance, structure, and visual consistency.  
Built with **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**, it emphasizes smooth animations, modular components, and SEO-friendly architecture.

This project serves as **Version 2** of my portfolio, evolving from [Portfolio_V1](https://github.com/swagatgharat/Portfolio_V1).
